# Physionet_Biosignals_Display_Analysis_Automated
The script allows you to display any physiological signal. For example ECG Signal display and analysis with R-Peak Detection, Heartrate Diagram and statistical analysis + Heart Rate Variability. Made for dat. or .hea files of Physionet.org. 
The reason this script was created is that there is no full and easy accessible solution from other forums and tutorials and especially a lot of error messages occur when using the Library of WFDB, so I created a fully functional and automitized script on my own, so anyone can get startet with biosignals from Physionet and other sources easily.

The script is automated and will ask you for the file you want to read in:

for tha data format:

for the number of samples that should be displayed:

Then the display of the Biosignals and annotations follows:

For ECGs a R-Peak Detection is performed:

A Heart Rate Diagram is computed:

A statistical Analysis is executed:

And the full description of the File with all information about channels, sample frequency etc. is displayed:

I hope you enjoy working with that program!
